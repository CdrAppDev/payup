# Can Hospitals Upload 835/837 Files? A Feasibility Assessment

**The file upload MVP is viable for a narrow market segment but faces significant friction.** Only **15-25%** of small and rural hospitals can realistically provide 835/837 files within one week without third-party involvement. For Critical Access Hospitals—the primary target market—the picture is more challenging: most outsource billing or rely on vendors like TruBridge where raw file access requires IT or vendor assistance. A clearinghouse partnership or portal-authorization approach offers a more scalable path to data access than direct file upload.

The core assumption that hospitals "have these files accessible and can export them without significant barriers" is **partially valid for recent data (30-90 days) but largely invalid for historical data**. Clearinghouses retain files for only 30 days in active mailboxes, and most hospitals don't store raw EDI files after importing them into billing systems. The file upload strategy could work as an initial entry point for early adopters but will require supplemental data access pathways to reach the broader market.

## The 835/837 lifecycle creates structural access barriers

**How files flow through the system:** 837 claim files are generated by hospital billing or practice management systems, transmitted to clearinghouses for scrubbing and validation, then routed to payers. After adjudication, payers send 835 remittance files back through the clearinghouse to the hospital. The critical insight: **clearinghouses sit at the center of this data flow**, handling roughly **97% of medical claims** electronically. Over 10 billion claims flow through US clearinghouses annually, with Availity alone processing 13 billion transactions.

**Raw files typically don't persist.** Most hospitals import 835/837 data into their billing systems and discard the original EDI files. The data lives on as database records in proprietary formats rather than exportable X12 files. While billing systems can regenerate 837 claims from stored data (Epic's "Refresh Claim" function, for example), they cannot recreate 835 remittance files—those originate from payers.

**Clearinghouse retention windows are narrow.** Availity and Change Healthcare/Optum maintain files in active mailboxes for **maximum 30 days**. Availity offers self-serve restoration for up to 6 months; beyond that requires special requests with uncertain availability. There is no standard long-term archive—a platform requesting "your last 6 months of 835 files" may find much of that data inaccessible through normal channels.

| Data Source | Typical Retention | Export Ease |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Clearinghouse active mailbox | 30 days | Moderate (portal download) |
| Clearinghouse archive | Up to 6 months | Requires restoration request |
| Billing system database | 7-10 years | Data converted to proprietary format |
| Raw EDI file storage | Rarely maintained | N/A for most hospitals |

## Export capabilities vary dramatically by system and require IT involvement

**No major billing system offers simple self-service EDI export.** Across Epic, Oracle Health (Cerner), MEDITECH, TruBridge/CPSI, athenahealth, eClinicalWorks, NextGen, and Allscripts, the consistent pattern is that raw 835/837 file access requires either clearinghouse portal navigation, IT-configured file drops, or vendor assistance. Billing staff can view processed data but typically cannot export raw EDI files without elevated permissions or technical support.

**TruBridge presents the highest barrier for the target market.** TruBridge (formerly CPSI/Evident) serves **1,500+ rural and community hospitals** and dominates the Critical Access Hospital segment. However, raw file export from TruBridge systems often requires vendor involvement or third-party data extraction services. Many TruBridge clients have their billing entirely managed by TruBridge's RCM services, meaning the hospital may not have direct system access at all. Legacy AccuCOBOL systems require specialized extraction, and eForms are encrypted, adding complexity.

**Epic and Cerner sites have more options but still need IT.** Epic sites can configure clearinghouse file drops or access data through Chronicles/Caboodle, but this requires IT configuration. Cerner requires CCL queries or dedicated analytics bundles. MEDITECH's NPR Report Writer can create custom exports, but requires training. Athenahealth and eClinicalWorks support SFTP delivery of EDI files but require setup configuration.

| System | Market Position | Self-Service Export? | Typical Export Path |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Epic | 42% acute care market | No | Clearinghouse portal or IT file drops |
| TruBridge | CAH market leader | No | Vendor assistance often required |
| MEDITECH | Strong in small hospitals | Partial | NPR Report Writer with training |
| athenahealth | Ambulatory/small | Partial | SFTP delivery after setup |
| eClinicalWorks | Ambulatory | Partial | SFTP export with configuration |

## Segment analysis reveals sharp disparities in file access readiness

### Large health systems (500+ beds): Low friction but wrong target

Large systems have centralized revenue cycle operations with dedicated data teams, data warehouses, and analytics infrastructure. They're **68%+ likely to use outsourced RCM** partners like R1 RCM or Ensemble, but maintain sophisticated IT capabilities. These organizations could provide data but expect enterprise-grade integration approaches, not file uploads. Timeline for vendor approval: **6-12 months**. They represent the wrong initial market for a file upload MVP.

### Mid-size community hospitals (100-500 beds): Mixed picture

MEDITECH, Epic Community Connect, and Oracle Health dominate this segment. In-house billing is more common than at larger systems, but technical sophistication varies widely. Some have revenue cycle analysts comfortable with clearinghouse portals; others rely heavily on their EHR vendor. **40-60% use partial or full RCM outsourcing.** Estimated **30-40%** could provide files within one week with internal effort; another 30% would need clearinghouse coordination or billing company involvement.

### Small hospitals under 100 beds: High variability

Small hospitals face severe resource constraints. Staff wear multiple hats—a single business office manager may oversee all revenue cycle functions. **42% still use legacy EHR systems**, and IT positions are chronically understaffed (far fewer applicants than clinical roles). Most access 835 files through clearinghouse portals rather than direct system exports. Estimated **20-30%** could provide files within one week; **50%+** would require third-party involvement (clearinghouse restoration, billing company request, or vendor support).

### Critical Access Hospitals: The hardest segment

The **1,377 CAHs** represent a concentrated target market but face the steepest barriers. Over **70% operate at financial losses**, limiting technology investment. Revenue cycle staff typically handle combined roles without specialized training. TruBridge dominates this segment, but as noted, raw file access from TruBridge often requires vendor cooperation.

When outsourcing billing—increasingly common among CAHs—the hospital may lose direct clearinghouse access entirely. The billing company controls the EDI file flow, and the hospital sees only dashboards and reports. A CAH asked to provide 835 files today would likely need to either log into their clearinghouse (if they retain access) or request files from their billing company—a process that could take days to weeks.

| Segment | Can Provide in 24 Hours | Can Provide in 1 Week | Needs Third-Party | Non-Viable |
|---------|------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Large (500+ beds) | 5% | 20% | 60% | 15% |
| Mid-size (100-500) | 10% | 35% | 45% | 10% |
| Small (<100 beds) | 8% | 25% | 50% | 17% |
| Critical Access | 5% | 18% | 55% | 22% |

*Estimates based on synthesis of outsourcing prevalence, system capabilities, and staffing patterns. Primary research needed to validate.*

## Outsourced billing fundamentally changes the data access equation

**Outsourcing prevalence is high and growing.** Roughly **74% of healthcare organizations** use vendors for partial RCM outsourcing (coding, denial management, collections), while about **6% fully outsource** to a single vendor. The RCM outsourcing market is growing at **14-15% annually**, driven by staffing shortages and financial pressure. Among CAHs specifically, outsourcing is increasingly common given limited internal resources.

**When billing is outsourced, data access becomes contract-dependent.** Hospitals legally own their claims data, but practical access depends on contractual terms that many organizations negotiated years ago without data portability in mind. Some hospitals retain clearinghouse portal access; others see only vendor-provided dashboards. Full-service RCM vendors like R1 RCM and Ensemble manage the entire EDI file flow—the hospital would need vendor cooperation to provide raw 835/837 files to a third party.

**Key barriers for outsourced hospitals:**
- Clearinghouse relationship may be held by the billing company
- BAA between hospital and billing company may restrict sharing PHI with additional parties
- Data export requests may require formal process with 30+ day turnaround
- Billing companies may charge fees for custom data exports
- Some contracts include unclear provisions around data use for analytics

**Recommended qualification questions for prospects:**
1. Do you handle billing in-house or outsource to a third-party RCM company?
2. If outsourced, do you retain direct clearinghouse portal access?
3. Can you download 835/837 files yourself, or does your billing company control that?

## Current vendors avoid file upload entirely

**No major RCM or analytics vendor offers true self-service file upload.** Research across Waystar, AKASA, R1 RCM, Ensemble, Aspirion, Rivet Health, OS Inc, Optum/Change Healthcare, and Availity reveals a consistent pattern: all require direct EHR/billing system integrations, managed implementations, or clearinghouse connections. The industry standard is white-glove onboarding lasting 6-24 weeks for most vendors, with enterprise implementations taking **180+ days**.

**Why the market has landed here:**
- **Data quality concerns:** Vendors want control over data ingestion to ensure accuracy
- **Higher contract values:** Managed services support premium pricing
- **Stickier relationships:** Deep integrations create switching costs
- **Security posture:** Controlled pipelines simplify compliance

**Clearinghouse-native vendors have natural data access.** Companies like Waystar (connects to 5,000+ payer endpoints), OS Inc (clearinghouse + analytics), and Optum/Change Healthcare don't need separate file uploads because they already sit in the claims flow. This suggests a **clearinghouse partnership approach** may be more viable than asking hospitals to upload files.

**Rivet Health and Aspirion represent lighter-weight models.** Rivet positions primarily as software/analytics rather than operational RCM, with lighter integration requirements. Aspirion's underpayment recovery works from remittance data without requiring full EHR integration. These use cases—retrospective analysis rather than real-time operational RCM—may be more suitable for file-based approaches.

| Vendor | Integration Approach | Timeline | File Upload? |
|--------|---------------------|----------|--------------|
| Waystar | 530+ pre-built integrations | Weeks-months | No |
| R1 RCM | HL7/Unified Data Exchange | 180+ days | No |
| Ensemble | EHR integration + AI | 90 days to results | No |
| AKASA | Standards-based APIs | 3-6 weeks (target) | No |
| Aspirion | Lighter system connections | Managed | No |
| Rivet Health | PM system integration | Lighter-weight | Closest to self-service |

## Security requirements create a 3-4 month minimum runway

**835/837 files unambiguously contain PHI.** These files include patient names, dates of birth, addresses, Social Security numbers, member IDs, diagnosis codes, procedure codes, and dates of service. They fall under HIPAA's designated record set protections. De-identification is **impractical for underpayment analysis** because matching 835 remittances to 837 claims requires patient and claim identifiers.

**A BAA is legally required before any data sharing.** There is no workaround—receiving PHI without a Business Associate Agreement is itself a HIPAA violation. Hospitals will also expect:
- SOC 2 Type I attestation (minimum for any deal): **3-4 months, $20-50K**
- SOC 2 Type II (expected by most mid-size+ hospitals): **6-12 months, $30-100K**
- HITRUST certification (increasingly required by large systems): **8-18 months, $80-200K+**
- Penetration test with no critical findings
- Cyber liability insurance ($1-5M coverage)
- Completed security questionnaire (SIG or similar)

**Approval timelines vary by hospital size:**
- Large health systems: 6-12 months through multiple committees
- Mid-size hospitals: 3-6 months standard process
- Community hospitals under 200 beds: 1-3 months
- Critical Access Hospitals: 2-8 weeks (less formal process)

**MVP critical path:** You cannot begin receiving hospital data without at minimum: HIPAA policies documented, risk assessment completed, encryption implemented (AES-256, TLS 1.2+), audit logging in place, incident response plan, and a BAA template ready. SOC 2 Type I can be achieved in parallel with early pilot conversations.

## Practical readiness matrix

**The "Can you send me your files today?" test produces sobering results:**

| Response Category | Large | Mid-Size | Small | CAH |
|-------------------|-------|----------|-------|-----|
| "Yes, I can export and email them" | 5% | 10% | 8% | 5% |
| "I'd need to ask IT" | 15% | 25% | 20% | 13% |
| "I'd need to figure out our clearinghouse" | 20% | 30% | 35% | 30% |
| "Our billing company has those" | 45% | 25% | 25% | 35% |
| "I don't know what an 835 file is" | 15% | 10% | 12% | 17% |

*Estimates synthesized from staffing patterns, outsourcing prevalence, and system capabilities. Validation through primary research strongly recommended.*

**Friction levels for obtaining 6 months of historical 835 data:**
- **Low friction (files in hand within 1 week):** ~20% of small/rural hospitals
- **Medium friction (requires coordination, 2-4 weeks):** ~35% 
- **High friction (billing company involvement, 4+ weeks):** ~30%
- **Effectively non-viable (no practical path to files):** ~15%

## Recommended entry point strategy

**File upload can work as an MVP for a narrow early-adopter segment, but plan for alternative pathways.** Target the ~20% of small/rural hospitals that handle billing in-house, retain clearinghouse access, and have a business office manager willing to navigate portal downloads. These hospitals face acute financial pressure (70%+ of CAHs operate at losses), understand their underpayment problem, and have the shortest security approval timelines (2-8 weeks).

**Practical MVP approach:**
1. **Clearinghouse portal guidance:** Create step-by-step instructions for downloading 835 files from Availity, Change Healthcare/Optum, and Office Ally. Most in-house billing hospitals access data this way. Provide screen recordings and templates.

2. **Accept multiple formats:** Support not just X12 835/837 but also CSV exports, spreadsheet formats, and processed data from billing system reports. Many hospitals can export data in non-EDI formats more easily.

3. **Start with recent data:** Focus on last 30-90 days initially (available in active clearinghouse mailboxes). Historical analysis can follow once the relationship is established and the hospital understands the process for requesting archived files.

4. **White-glove first uploads:** The first file upload for any customer will likely require hand-holding. Plan for 2-4 hours of customer success support per initial implementation—staff unfamiliarity with file formats and clearinghouse navigation is the norm, not the exception.

**Parallel pathways to build:**

- **Clearinghouse portal authorization:** Work with customers who grant credentials or OAuth access to their clearinghouse portals. This shifts the technical burden from hospital staff to your platform.

- **Clearinghouse data partnerships:** Explore partnerships with Availity, Change Healthcare/Optum, or regional clearinghouses to access data on behalf of authorized hospitals. This is how several established vendors solve the access problem at scale.

- **Billing company relationships:** For the 30-40% of small hospitals that outsource billing, establish relationships with major regional billing companies serving the CAH market (TruBridge, regional billing services). They could become channel partners rather than barriers.

## Key unknowns requiring primary research

Secondary research cannot definitively answer several critical questions:

1. **Actual file availability:** What percentage of small hospital business office managers can locate and download an 835 file from their clearinghouse portal within 30 minutes? Testing this with real prospects is essential.

2. **Staff technical comfort:** How do business office managers respond to seeing raw X12 EDI format? Does it create confusion or confidence? Would a format conversion step (EDI to spreadsheet) reduce friction?

3. **Clearinghouse access in outsourced situations:** When hospitals outsource billing, do they typically retain read access to clearinghouse portals, or is that relationship fully handed off?

4. **Billing company cooperation:** Will third-party billing companies facilitate data sharing with analytics vendors, or view them as competitive threats? What fees do they charge for custom data exports?

5. **Security flexibility at CAHs:** Given resource constraints, will Critical Access Hospitals work with vendors still pursuing SOC 2 Type I, or do they have informal minimum requirements that vary by institution?

6. **Historical data needs:** What lookback period is actually required for underpayment identification? If 90 days is sufficient to identify patterns, the clearinghouse retention limitation becomes less problematic.

**Recommended validation:** Conduct 15-20 structured interviews with CAH business office managers and CFOs. Test the file request scenario directly: "If I asked you to send me your last 90 days of 835 files today, what would you need to do?" Document the actual steps, barriers, and time required. This primary research will sharpen the market sizing and inform product design decisions.
